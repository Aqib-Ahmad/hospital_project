        <p >The dream turned in to reality with the setting up of Lok Hospital in February 1997. To help serve patients better, Bethany Trust, which owned and managed the erstwhile Lok Hospital, unveiled a comprehensive new world class healthcare facility that combines compassion with the finest in diagnostic and therapeutic technology. Bethany Hospital, a 125-bedded multi-specialty hospital, became operational in June 2011. Further, in March 2018 Bethany Hospital unveiled in a phase wise manner its new wing with additional of beds, Surgical and Interventional Cardiac Care. At the heart of these two 8-storeyed structures is the same belief that undergirded the ethos of Lok Hospital - life is a precious gift of God and deserves our utmost attention.</p><br>

This 190-bed, centrally air-conditioned hospital is fully equipped for world-class patient-centred medical and surgical services.
